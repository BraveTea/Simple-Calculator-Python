A simple calculator made in Python 3. 

A simple calculator made in Python 3. 
The first working programme I typed in Python. Mind you I say 'I typed', because I haven't thought this up by myself but was an example in a tutorial. 
Except for one line of code (8) I understand what is happening on every line. 
For now my goals are to:
- understand line 8 ' user_input = input(": ")
- make this code more DRY and more effective
- expand on the options of the calculator


NB The original code had a print() function in every single elif statement. I already moved this to outside the if/elif blocks to reduce on lines of code.
